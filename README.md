# Zymon

Open Source Engine clone of PKMN, inspired by Cyriel's OpMon project that I am also contributing too.
The purpose of doing this over simply contributing to OpMon is because this is not a game. This is an engine. The engine comes with tools to create maps and Zymon and more, and there likely will be a default game to go along with this. However, this is mostly a community driven, portable, OS project for fun.

There are no current plans to make an installer or release version for the engine. However, if you feel like it, please feel free to do so. You are probably better at creating UI and GUI stuff than I am.

# Compiling

Pretty simple. Compatible with Code::Blocks and VS 2017. I use SFML 2.5.1 which is the most current at the time of writing. It will probably work with some other versions though.
Submit an issue if you have any problems related to the compiling. Help with linking will not be provided, nor with anything not strictly related to problems with the above code.
